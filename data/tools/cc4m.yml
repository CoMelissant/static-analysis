  CC4M is a tool to easily check your MATLAB Code, Simulink Models, and Stateflow Charts against your company''s 
  or your team''s coding standard. CC4M includes a convenient approach to easily configure and run checks. 
  Furthermore, CC4M provides an M-Code analyzer to enable running checks on variables and functions as easy as 
  checks on Simulink and Stateflow properties.
